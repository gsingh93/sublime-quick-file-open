Quick File Open
===============

This is a Sublime Text 2/3 plugin for quickly opening files. Sublime Text offers
the ability to quickly switch between workspaces, but there is no way to quickly
open a set of "Favorite" files. This plugin allows you to specify this set of
"Favorite" files in the QuickFileOpen.sublime-settings file. The files can then
be accessed by hitting ctrl+alt+shift+p, which can be configured in the user
keybindings file.

Here is an example settings file:

```
{
    "files": ["file1", "file2"]
}
```
